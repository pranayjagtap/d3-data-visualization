            <p>D3 library is used to encode data into below visualizations.<p>
            <p>Features and interactions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Filter Interaction : Data by year , Data by round of play</li>
                <li>Annotation Interaction : See popup annotations on mouse hover over circle in scatter plot, bar graph, line chart </li>
                <li>Click interaction: Click on circles of scatterplot to generate drilled down view in the form of line graph, click on bars of bar chart to get sctterplot of detail view</li>
                <li>Lasso & focus Interaction: Draw a lasso area using mouse drag forming an enclosed area and selected points pop out while others disable and a grid is enabled for a focused view.  </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li> The first visualization is a scatter plot which is useful to see relation between winner points scored by two players.</li>
                <li> Each points effectively represent a match and thus can be viewed as an abstract overview.</li>
                <li> On hovering over the points, user can see the names of players and the points each scored in that match. This plot is interactive in nature.</li>
                <li> When the user <b>clicks on certain point</b>, a new line graph is generated which gives statistics about the two players who played that match.</li>
                <li> This new visualiztion encodes the path of points scored by each player over the years. Two line graphs are used for each player: one to show total points scored over the years in winning matches and the other shows the total points scored by the player in his losing matches.</li>
                <li> User can <b>hover over the points</b> in newly generated line graph to see values for particular year.<li>
                <li> <b>Nested data structure</b> was created in order to get the sum of points scored by a player in a year with Player as key1 and year as its internal key2 and sum of total points that year being the vaulue to key2. </li>
                <li> As a part of interaction requirement, <b>two filters are added in the form of drop down menus</b> which allows user to filter data with <b>years and round of play</b>.
                    <li>For example, if you wish to see a scatter plot of all the semi final matches, you can select semi finals in second drop down while leaving first drop down as 'All matches'.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, if you want to view all third round matches for the year 2005, select 2005 in years drop down and third round in rounds drop down.</li></li>
                <li> As a part of bonus charts, a bar chart is plotted that gives an overview by showing sum of errors caused by losing players every year. Hovering over the bar will show details.</li>
                <li> When user clicks on any of these graphs, a new scatterplot is generated which shows a comparison of errors by player who won against errors made by players who lost for that particular year.</li>
                <li> This new scatter plot has <b>LASSO feature enabled</b> on it.
                <li> Select a particular region by dragging your mouse around interested points <b>forming an enclosed area with your mouse</b> and those points pop out while others disable along with a grid appearing for better view and focus on lasso selected points. </li></li>
