            <p>D3 library is used to encode data into below visualizations.<p>
            <p>Features and interactions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Filter Interaction : Data by year , Data by round of play</li>
                <li>Annotation Interaction : See popup annotations on mouse hover over circle in scatter plot, bar graph, line chart </li>
                <li>Click interaction: Click on circles of scatterplot to generate drilled down view in the form of line graph, click on bars of bar chart to get sctterplot of detail view</li>
                <li>Lasso & focus Interaction: Draw a lasso area using mouse drag forming an enclosed area and selected points pop out while others disable and a grid is enabled for a focused view.  </li>

            <h4 align="center">WRITE UP</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> The first visualization is a scatter plot which is useful to see relation between winner points scored by two players.</li>
                <li> Each points effectively represent a match and thus can be viewed as an abstract overview.</li>
                <li> On hovering over the points, user can see the names of players and the points each scored in that match. This plot is interactive in nature.</li>
                <li> When the user <b>clicks on certain point</b>, a new line graph is generated which gives statistics about the two players who played that match.</li>
                <li> This new visualiztion encodes the path of points scored by each player over the years. Two line graphs are used for each player: one to show total points scored over the years in winning matches and the other shows the total points scored by the player in his losing matches.</li>
                <li> User can <b>hover over the points</b> in newly generated line graph to see values for particular year.</li>
                <li> <b>Nested data structure</b> was created in order to get the sum of points scored by a player in a year with Player as key1 and year as its internal key2 and sum of total points that year being the vaulue to key2. </li>
                <li> As a part of interaction requirement, <b>two filters are added in the form of drop down menus</b> which allows user to filter data with <b>years and round of play</b>.
                    <li>For example, if you wish to see a scatter plot of all the semi final matches, you can select semi finals in second drop down while leaving first drop down as 'All matches'.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, if you want to view all third round matches for the year 2005, select 2005 in years drop down and third round in rounds drop down.</li></li>
                <li> As a part of bonus charts, a bar chart is plotted that gives an overview by showing sum of errors caused by losing players every year. Hovering over the bar will show details.</li>
                <li> When user clicks on any of these graphs, a new scatterplot is generated which shows a comparison of errors by player who won against errors made by players who lost for that particular year.</li>
                <li> This new scatter plot has <b>LASSO feature enabled</b> on it.
                <li> Select a particular region by dragging your mouse around interested points <b>forming an enclosed area with your mouse</b> and those points pop out while others disable along with a grid appearing for better view and focus on lasso selected points. </li></li>
				
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<b>Examples</b>
				<li>Scatterpot Winner points- By selecting year 2012 and selecting round of play as qarter finals, user will see the four matches and plot of winner points by both players. By clicking on circle for Rafael Nadal and Tomas Berdych, a line graph appears on right which shows stats of two players. From line graph it can be seen that total points scored by Rafael Nadal in his winning matches is higher than Tomas in his winning matches. However in their losing matches Tomas did slightly better than Nadal from 2007 to 2010.Hover over points to get annotation with details.</li>
				<li> Bar Chart shows total of errors done by all players in their losing matches. When user clicks on 2012 bar, a scatterplot of all error1 vs error2 is generated. On selecting a lasso area around 4 specific circles, other circles disappear and these are highlighted along with line grids to get clearer view.</li>
				
			</ul>

			<ul>
				<b>Marks and channels</b>
				<li>Winner1 and Winner1 encoded as Points on scatterplot, line generated using total1 and total2 , error1 and erro2 act as mark or basic elements in vsiualizations while their position ongraphs and line's path acts as channel or appearance of these marks.</li>
